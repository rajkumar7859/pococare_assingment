### JWT-based Authentication and Authorization System
### Deployment 
#### https://frontend-rajkumar7859.vercel.app/register
This is a sample implementation of a JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication and authorization system. It includes a backend server implemented using Node.js and Express, a database using MongoDB and a frontend client implemented using React.js.

### The implementation follows the below specifications:

The system uses JWTs for authentication and authorization.
The JWT has a finite expiry date, which is set to 1 hour in this implementation.
All routes except the login route must be protected by the Auth Token.
On the frontend, all requests going to the server must have the Auth Token in the header.
If any API call returns a 401 error, a refresh-token mechanism tries to renew the token.
If the refresh token fails, the user is directed to login.
Email and password are used for login and registration.
Backend Server

The backend server is implemented using Node.js and Express. It provides the API endpoints for authentication and authorization, and also serves as the API gateway for the frontend client.

The server uses JWTs for authentication and authorization. When the user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's ID and some other information. The JWT is then returned to the client, which can use it to authenticate and authorize itself for future API calls.

The server also implements a refresh-token mechanism. When the user logs in, the server generates a refresh token and stores it in the database. If the JWT expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new JWT. If the refresh token is invalid, the client is directed to login again.

The server uses MongoDB as its database. The user's email and password are stored in the database, along with the refresh token.

### Frontend Client

The frontend client is implemented using React.js. It provides the user interface for the login and registration screens, and also interacts with the backend server through API calls.

The client uses the JWT to authenticate and authorize itself for API calls. When the user logs in, the client stores the JWT in the browser's local storage. All subsequent API calls made by the client include the JWT in the header.

If any API call returns a 401 error, the client tries to renew the token using the refresh token. If the refresh token fails, the client redirects the user to login again.

The client uses Axios for making API calls to the backend server.

Setup Instructions

To set up the system, follow the below instructions:

Clone the repository.
Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
Navigate to the backend folder and run npm install to install the dependencies.
Navigate to the frontend folder and run npm install to install the dependencies.
Start the MongoDB server by running mongod in the terminal.
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following variables:
DB_URI: The URI of the MongoDB database.
JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for signing and verifying the JWT.
JWT_EXPIRY: The expiry time of the JWT in seconds.
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY: The expiry time of the refresh token in seconds.
Start the backend server by running npm start in the backend folder.
Start the frontend client by running npm start in the frontend folder.
Conclusion

This is a simple implementation of a JWT-based authentication and authorization system. It can be extended to include additional features such as user roles, permissions, and access control.

JWT-based Authentication and Authorization System

This system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization. The JWT has a finite expiry date of 1 hour, and all routes except the login route are protected by the Auth Token. The backend server is implemented using Node.js and Express, with a MongoDB database. The frontend client is implemented using React.js and Axios. The client stores the JWT in local storage and includes it in all API calls to the server. If a call returns a 401 error, the client attempts to renew the token using the refresh token. If the refresh token fails, the user is directed to login. The system uses email and password for login and registration.
